## Testing

### Automated Testing
Test 1 - Testing that a new array element is added when the user adds a new chore to the list
````
chores = [chore1, chore2, chore3]
# Testing Add_New_Chores Method
def check_add_new_chores(chores)
    initial_number_of_chores = chores.length
    new_chore_list = add_new_chore(chores)
    if new_chore_list.length - initial_number_of_chores >=1
        return "Test passes!".colorize(:green)
    else
        return "Test fails ðŸ˜­".colorize(:red)
    end
end
````
